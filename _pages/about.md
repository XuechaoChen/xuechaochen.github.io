Welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University advised by Prof. [Yang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_qMiOloAAAAJ) and Prof. [Qixing Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pamL_rIAAAAJ). I obtained my master's degree from Tsinghua University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Lu Fang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C1YeBLMAAAAJ). My current research interest is the 3D perception and understanding of autonomous robots.
