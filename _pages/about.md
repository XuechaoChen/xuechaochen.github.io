Welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University advised by Prof. Yang Li and Prof. Qixing Huang. I obtained my master's degree from Tsinghua University in 2023, advised by Prof. Lu Fang. My current research interest is the 3D perception and understanding of autonomous robots.
